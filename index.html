    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    
    <p>Code for America is a San Francisco based non-profit that believes government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century. Code for America works with cities to build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.</p>

	<p>The Fellowship program sends teams of experienced technologists into local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials. The fellows apply 21st Century Government Principles to important problems.</p>

	<p>In conjunction, the team is excited to work with leaders in city hall and the community to find new solutions to old problems. We are passionate about doing, not just thinking and will work to always keep our work open and transparent through regularly publishing our work and findings online, holding discussions and co-design session with both community and city partners, and aligning our principles and themes with clear input and validation from experts not only in subject matter but proximity.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    
    <h3>What is the objective?</h3>
    
    <p>As New Mexico’s largest city, the City of Albuquerque is working to increase opportunities for economic development and social mobility for all residents. The CfA has partnered with the Albuquerque Mayor’s Office to research and build interventions to the barriers that residents face in accessing critical information, services, and employment opportunities. Code for America fellows will test and develop a technology solution that facilitates upward mobility for Albuquerque residents. The overall goal — as outlined by the city — is to “enhance the upward mobility of residents by focusing on economic development initiatives.”</p>
    
    <p>To help us understand what that means in digestible terms — here are some points from our initial brief:</p>
    
	<ul>
		<li>Make more people "employable"</li>
		<li>Remove barriers to information about jobs, job opportunities, employer incentives</li>
		<li>Create pathways from family services to skills for employment to access to jobs</li>
		<li>Surface and identify 'soft skills and services' to enable people to look for work (daycare, nice clothes, etc).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>How will this affect the City of Albuquerque?</h3>
	
	<p>There are two types of defined outcomes, <strong>Primary</strong> and <strong>Organizational</strong>.</p>
	
	<h4>Primary Outcomes</h4>
	
	<p>The largest is to connect the dots and standardize some of the communications and data being shared between the city and it’s residents around economic development departments, initiatives, and community partners. The city would also like to see us ‘refresh’ some of the technology now used for skills based hiring. Including hiring within city hall. Another stinging objective is to improve access to talent for small businesses moving to or operating out of the metro area.</p>
	
	<h4>Organization Outcomes</h4>
	
	<p>The first thing we heard from our city partner when we stepped foot in City Hall is to be ‘catalyst for change!’ No kidding, by the brief it states: “make stakeholders see that change is possible and inexpensive.” Another outcome, that’s less ominous is to grow the civic tech community and improve sustainability for new services. Lastly, to scale up data opportunities and allow the city to become “information rich, instead of simply data rich.”</p>
	
	<p>As a team we look to achieve a bold solution to a bold problem — by setting our aims high we can fail gracefully — in a way that builds trust towards the boom and bust tendencies of the work in technological fields. In hopes that our actions will inspire others to think differently about how to operate local governments in the 21st century.</p>

			        <h3>Dashboard</h3>
			        <p>As part of the Digital Front Door Phase 1, we developed a dashboard for the city to monitor use of the website and worked with Mai-Ling Garcia to make it available throughout the city government, including on a live screen in Oakland City Hall. Residents visiting can now see a live track of search terms, top pages and current traffic on the site.</p>

			        	<figcaption>Early dashboard in the City of Oakland 9th floor</figcaption>
		        	</figure>
			        <p>The purpose of providing a dashboard was to provide a sense of the non-visible users of the city’s services to staff that are responsible for them, to show that there are many more of their constituents seeking the city’s help through online means than there often are in person in city hall every day.  It also provides a first look at which services and information is more frequently trafficked by the public, so that development priorities can be made for improving the site.</p>
			        <p>The dashboard began as a fork of an open-source project developed by Edd Sowden of the UK’s Government Digital Service. Initially deployed onto a screen in the open plan 9th floor office at Oakland City Hall, Mai-Ling was later able to procure an all-in-one screen/computer to display the dashboard in a public location inside City Hall, so that passing staff and public can view the same live traffic information and get a sense for the virtual visitors. It also prompted the start of Mai-Ling’s “Web Analytics Club”, held monthly, where city employees from various departments gather to better view, understand and analyze the visitor data from their site together in collaborative way.</p>

			        <p>We improved the <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/city-analytics-dashboard">codebase</a> and made it <a href="http://dfd-dashboard-setup.herokuapp.com/">readily redeployable</a> for many other cities in the process, turning the dashboard into a full Code for America product, with attribution to Oakland as the initial city where the innovation took place. It has already been deployed in San Antonio, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and more and we expect to see many cities adopt and create information screens like this in the future.</p>

			        <h3>Resident Research</h3>
			        <h4>Broad Survey of Oakland residents on previous website use and Internet access</h4>
			        <p>We conducted an online survey of approximately 1,000 people (0.25% of Oakland’s population); since our initial goal was a sample of 1 in 1,000 residents (or approximately 400 responses), we were extremely pleased with the overall high level of participation. We asked residents to tell us their neighborhood, age, and Internet and cell phone use, and then asked them to prioritize common city website needs and tell us about past experiences with the City of Oakland site. </p>
			        <p>The survey was available on desktop, tablet or mobile, in English, Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese. We posted the survey on the City of Oakland website, on the City’s official Facebook and Twitter pages. We distributed over 7,000 flyers across Oakland. In addition, Mai-Ling Garcia, Online Engagement Manager, reached out to more than 30 community organizations (see Appendix B for full list) to solicit participation from their members and worked with Oakland’s City Council to garner response.</p>
			        <p>In crafting a survey for a broad audience, we wanted a curated set of priorities for residents to choose from. We analyzed the top search results on Google for the 100 largest cities by population in the US and tagged and rolled up the results to arrive at this list.</p>
			        <figure>
			        	<img src="assets/priorities.png" />
			        	<figcaption>List of priorities</figcaption>
		        	</figure>
			        <p>Identifying items from the list that were important to each respondent became a central question in the survey.</p>
			        <p>We also asked respondents if they had ever visited Oakland’s official website, what they had been doing the last time they visited, and any comments on that last experience.</p>
			        <h4>Preliminary Assumptions</h4>
			        <p>We began the survey process with certain assumptions:</p>
			        <ol>
			        	<li>Given the short timeframe of our project, and the focus on existing web users, we decided to conduct the survey primarily online. We assumed that we would receive very few responses from people who don’t have regular Internet access. While acknowledging that this lack of access affects a significant portion of Oakland’s population, we felt that the focus on existing users was justified by the need to evaluate existing experiences.
			        		<ol>
			        			<li>This assumption held true: only 0.2% of all respondents said they do not use the web. <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/data-trend/internet-use/offline-adults/">National statistics</a> show that around 15% of Americans don’t use the web, so if Oakland is similar, about 15% of population, largely people over 65, is not represented at all in our results.</li>
			        		</ol>
			        	</li>
			        	<li>We assumed that Oakland’s experience with its own population would mean that the city had appropriate, tried-and-true tactics for quickly reaching a broad cross-section of residents through digital channels. 
			        		<ol>
			        			<li>This assumption did not hold true. The administrative side of the government does not have existing, easy channels for engaging with residents online. This presents a huge opportunity for joint learning as part of this project, but it led to results that are skewed by geography and likely by income in the initial survey period.</li>
			        			<li>We are addressing this by stating to the best of our ability how the bias in participation biases the results, and continuing to collect responses, with a focus on the under-represented areas, for another round of analysis in December.</li>
			        		</ol>
			        	</li>
			        	<li>We assumed that the topics represented in the final rolled-up analysis of the top 100 cities by population would also be topics of top interest to Oakland residents, because while each city has a unique character, the needs of people are broadly similar.
			        		<ol>
			        			<li>This assumption held true. While about 54% of respondents answered the question “is there anything important that we didn’t list above”, many of them answered “no” or listed something that actually fit in one of the categories. </li>
			        		</ol>
			        	</li>
			        </ol>
			       
				      <h4><a name="resident-survey-results"></a>Resident Survey Results</h4>
				      <p>1. Channels of Internet Access</p>
				      <p>95% of the people who responded have Internet access via a computer at home. Note that we didn’t specifically ask about broadband access, so this may count individuals who have slow or unreliable access, but who nonetheless get online. We believe the City needs to serve people with slow or unreliable connections as well as those with full broadband - this will be a critical design value for the Alpha and Beta websites.</p>
				      <p>3.3% of the respondents are what we define as mobile-primary Internet users. While they may have access to the Internet through a work computer, a public computer, or a friend’s computer, the channel of access *of their own* that they have is a mobile device. </p>
				      <p>We believe that mobile-primary users are significantly under-represented in our sample, at least if the most reliable available national statistics are correct. A <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2014/2/14/modern-makeover-discussions-digital-divide/">Knight Foundation</a> study published in February 2014 found that between 10-15% of Internet users fall into this category. While we may have a somewhat higher count of people with home-based Internet because we didn’t specifically ask for broadband, we don’t think that accounts for the full gap. Even in our small and probably under-counted sample, mobile-only users were concentrated among people who filled out the survey in Spanish, Chinese or Vietnamese. It’s very important that we understand the needs of these residents as we go forward; this is the major motivation for continuing to pursue responses to the survey, especially among less-privileged communities.</p>
				      <p>0.8% of respondents fall in a category we’ve called “Challenged Internet Access” - basically, they don’t have an access channel of their own, either at home or through a mobile device, and they use a work, public, or friend’s computer to get online.We believe this profile is likely to correspond with higher need for city services, so we are also working to gain a deeper understanding of these residents’ experience. </p>

				      <p>There are two areas in East and West Oakland with especially-high response rates shown above. West Oakland near South Prescott neighborhood and the North Stonehurst neighborhood in deep East Oakland are mixed residential/industrial with low 2010 populations.</p>

							(R: –0.34) and most positively with White population (R: +0.30). It’s correlated less negatively 
							with Black population (R: –0.19) and median household income (R: +0.19, see next page). Response rate is not significantly correlated with Asian population (R: +0.05).</p>

							<p><a name="geography-process"></a>Geography process</p>
							<p>We asked each participant “What Oakland neighborhood do you live in?,” and allowed free-text responses so respondents could accurately describe their location. Values ranged all widely, from close matches to CEDA-defined neighborhood names, to council districts, zip codes, and large areas like “East Oakland.” We matched each response to an existing spatial dataset hosted by OpenOakland.org (<a href="http://data.openoakland.org/dataset/neighborhoods-ceda-2002">1</a>, <a href="http://data.openoakland.org/dataset/council-districts">2</a>, <a href="http://data.openoakland.org/dataset/city-regions">3</a>), often making judgement calls about neighborhood identity based on local Oakland knowledge and erring on the side of larger regions.</p>
							<p>With spatial dataset in hand, we were able to correlate response locations with U.S. 2010 <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_ct.html">Census tract geographies</a>:</p>
							<blockquote>
								<p>Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity that are updated by local participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program.</p>
								<p>Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.</p>
							</blockquote>
							<p>We calculated correlation by coverage. For example, if a given neighborhood spanned three census tracts, we distributed neighborhood participants among them based on intersection areas. We created an <a href="http://forever.codeforamerica.org/Oakland-DFD-Phase-1-Report/Oakland-DFD-survey-2014-10-24.zip">output geographic dataset</a> with responses in each Oakland tract, allowing us to compare responses to demographic data such as race, age or income.</p>
							<p>For population counts and racial demographics, we used data downloads of the <a href="http://www.census.gov/2010census/data/">2010 decennial census</a>. For household income, we used data downloads of the <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/2012_release/">2012 ACS 5-year estimates</a>. This allowed us to compare information at the tract level; 5-year estimates have <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/guidance_for_data_users/estimates/">data for all areas, with a large sample size sacrificing currency for reliability</a>.</p>
							<p>Complete output data is available in shapefile format here: <a href="http://forever.codeforamerica.org/Oakland-DFD-Phase-1-Report/Oakland-DFD-survey-2014-10-24.zip">http://forever.codeforamerica.org/Oakland-DFD-Phase-1-Report/Oakland-DFD-survey-2014-10-24.zip</a></p>
							<p>We saw strong responses in areas where there was high levels of digital engagement by city council members. In particular, we observed a correlation between social media promotion and newsletter inclusion particularly in Council District 3 (West Oakland) where there were high response rates. Council districts 1 & 4 included mention of the web survey in email correspondence, outreach to neighborhood groups which resulted in small spikes early in the survey promotion.</p>

							<p>3. Age</p>
							<p>Our participation was well distributed across age groups. We were particularly pleased to have strong participation from people over 65. Of note for development, we found that the age of the respondent had a strong correlation with the likelihood that they use the web on a mobile device.</p>

							<p>While not everyone who uses the web on a mobile device is a mobile-primary user as defined above, all of these people have expectations about their experience of mobile web applications.</p>

							<p>4. Business Owner</p>
							<p>17.6% of respondents are business owners. While we did not collect further information about the nature of respondents’ businesses, most are likely small business owners.</p>

							<p>Conclusions from demographics:</p>
							<p>Based on the demographics of our sample contrasted with the US Census data on demographics of Oakland, we believe our initial survey over-counts wealthy, white, english-speaking residents and under-counts poor, non-white residents who speak other languages. We would expect the following skews in our data if this is the case:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>our data would under-rate the importance of the “jobs with the city” category (this is a top search result for nearly all cities, but was one of the lower-rated topics in our sample). However, it rated strongly among people with mobile-primary or challenged Internet access.</li>
								<li>our data would under-rate the importance of features for mobile-primary users, especially for critical city services.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Accordingly, we plan to give these issues greater prominence in the Alpha website and in future work than their ratings in the survey alone would support, and to continue outreach to communities that may have limited Internet access to complete the survey.</p>
							<p>One last benefit to note: 68% of the residents who responded to the survey offered us their contact information for the purpose of further website feedback. We plan to make use of these contacts as the beginning of a resource the City can use in setting up a practice of regular research with citizens.</p>

							<p>Responses to the “other” category that did not actually fit into one of the 12 main groups were primarily about either events, housing issues, school questions, or matters that are handled by different local governments like vital records and weddings.</p>

							<p>Results: previous visits to Oaklandnet.com</p>

							<p>82.8% of our respondents had visited the official city website.

							<p>Reasons for people’s last visit to the website were widely varied, from looking up planning documents and public records to paying parking tickets and finding trash pickup days. However, very few fell outside the 12-topic list above. A complete list is in Appendix A.</p>

							<p>Of those who visited the website previously, 68% were able to complete the task they set out to do. While municipal sites are complex, the target would normally be something in the 90% range. From further observation, our best hypothesis as to why the number is low has to do with the complexity of the navigation (note also the top rating given to the “Navigating the city” category in the topic list). </p>

							<p>Ability to complete common tasks will be a key metric for the Alpha site and future development. (See Recommendations.)</p>

			        <h3>In-Person User Interviews</h3>
			        <p>We piloted a process of more in-depth user research with the cross-department Parking Working Group. This observational interview method is a core practice in modern web development and communication organizations. We plan to rely on it as we develop the Beta website in Phase 2; we expect to train multiple city staff in how to conduct research this way.</p>
			        <p>For our pilot, we used Twitter to recruit three Oakland residents who had interacted with parking somehow in the preceding six months. The residents came to City Hall individually and were interviewed for 20-30 minutes while using the integrated parking information page. Members of the Communications department and the Parking Working Group observed the sessions and worked with CfA staff to prioritize the findings.</p>
			        <p>We specifically wanted to work with the Parking Working Group because this team had already taken it upon themselves to improve the parking information, having moved much of the pertinent text to one single location on the website, with a navigation, useful photography and links to other services on the website.  This work alone was already a tremendous improvement on the previously available information, but also provided us with an excellent opportunity to test a section of the site that had recently been revived and further encourage this type of cavalier improvement from the group by providing them with immediate feedback on their work.</p>

			        <h4>Findings from parking user research</h4>
			        <p>In general the one-page parking experience was a success and an improvement over what existed before.  Previously, the parking information was scattered around the website with no clear page to visit to find out the most common information users seek.</p>
			        <p>Users appreciated the ability to locate all of the information about parking in one location, however, they also reported that the page was very long.  They did not realise they could scroll down the page to find further information on various topics, and missed the navigational links at the start of the page, as they were located beneath some introductory text.</p>
			        <p>In response to this, the content owners of this page moved the navigational anchor links to the very top of the page (see image below), to make them more obvious to users.  Similarly, this was reflected in the Alpha by emphasising where the user is in the site, through breadcrumbs, and the scope of the available information, via a clearer browse format.</p>
			        <figure>
			        	<img src="assets/parking.png" />
			        	<figcaption>Oakland Parking information</figcaption>
		        	</figure>
			        <p>The testing also showed that when beginning from the Oakland homepage, users were unable to easily browse to the parking area, nor were they able to search for the page - as older, out of date parking information would be returned first, with the correct information being returned much lower in the search results, both by the internal search functions and from Google.  As the users realised that search was not helping them to locate the content, they would fallback to manually navigating around the site to try and find the correct information via browsing.  Generally, users then would become frustrated when they could not locate the information in expected sections, or were sent on loops around the same, incorrect, content.</p>
			        <p>This feedback has also been combined into the Alpha, by ensuring that the service information (such as parking) is located within sections that users expect to find it in (generally “transport”) and that the page is properly formatted, and correct keywords used throughout the content and URL structures to improve SEO.</p>

			        <h3>City Staff Research</h3>
			        <p>We conducted hour-long one-on-one interviews with 16 city staffers who are point people for the Oaklandnet.com website for their departments. The interviews were wide-ranging and open-ended. We asked each participant to describe his or her job responsibilities, how the website fits into them, and how they perform and evaluate the effectiveness of their web-related duties. We removed the participants’ names, transcribed the interviews, and performed a topic analysis in collaboration with Oakland city staff. </p>
			        <h4>Results from staff interviews</h4>
			        <p>We found a high degree of technical competency among staff who work on the website, though not one that was obvious in traditional ways. Staff put in extra time and effort to ensure that they communicate with their constituents as appropriate, and they are tenacious and clever in getting this done in the face of technical challenges. Most experience technical challenges in virtually every interaction with the content management system. </p>
			        <p>Most staff members we spoke with take advantage of modern technology such as mobile devices, online shopping, and social networks in their personal lives, but few expect the tools they use at work to offer similarly supportive experiences. We believe this is a mistake. It is completely possible to have powerful publishing tools that are as easy to use as consumer websites; if Oakland city staff were able to cut by 50% or 75% the amount of time they spend on repetitive web-related tasks, they would be able to reinvest that time in excellent content for their constituents. Several staff mentioned a desire to communicate with citizens in more modern digital channels, using shorter posts, infographics, podcasts, and the like. However, this is not supported by the current system.</p>
			        <p>For many staff, putting something online is a final step in a content production process centered around producing paper documents, or paper analogs such as PDFs. They do not have the tools to truly design web content for their constituents, and current policy does not support a digital-first work model. Additionally, PDFs are often created as a work around to creating web pages or searchable content on the City website.</p>
			        <p>It’s also worth noting that very many staff use the website as a tool to find information about or owned by other departments, or to assist the public in finding information. In fact, nearly 18% of web sessions in the last month to the City website are from the City of Oakland. They are among the site’s heaviest users and strongest critics, stating in many cases that their deep knowledge of the government’s structure does not help them find the information they need.</p>
			        <blockquote>
			        	<p>“I have no web experience. But I’m responsible for 2500 pages”</p>
			        	<p>“I put as much as I can into the content server, close it, open up a whole new Internet session, click on edit mode, and then maybe the documents that I’ve loaded are ready. Images I come back half an hour later. If I can remember, I usually don’t write the number down, if I get interrupted in the process, it’s over. That happens a lot.”</p>
			        	<p>“Everything is on the govt tab, but if you don’t understand our frequently changing bureaucratic hierarchy, you can’t find the info you’re looking for.”</p>
			        	<p>“If it was user-friendly, you could have more people updating content, or the same people doing it with greater regularity. I go and do it, I’m gonna take an hour or two and do it all at once, do everything everybody asked me. It’s not easy to do, so I think we do it less as a result.”</p>
			        	<p>“Getting the right look and feel, we don’t have anyone for that, would be great to have someone who could consult with you to do this, be able to generate the pretty thing to put online. Usually the pretty thing gets posted other ways besides online.”</p>
			        	<p>“I’ve got a complaint, i’ve got a pothole, i had a bad interaction with a city employee, or i had a great interaction with my tax collector and it was painless and respectful. i had a really great time with the oakland park and rec program, the city should expand this one. we have no centralized way to capture that feedback!...Website is a critical tool for capturing that, and it’s a paradigm shift -- that capability would allow upper management, administration, would push departments and directors to consider public input.”</p>

			    <article id="survey">
			        <h3>Staff Survey</h3>
			        <p>We also conducted a broader survey of city staff web activities and pain points. The survey was offered to nearly all city staff with email addresses as an optional, and optionally anonymous, web survey. 272 people responded.</p>
			        <p>We asked staff how many hours per day (if any) they use their work computers, what they primarily use them for, how they use the Internet outside of work, whether they use the intranet, the oaklandnet.com website, and the Oracle CMS as part of their jobs, and if so how what they use them for. We asked for ratings and explanations of ratings for the content management system.</p>
			        <h4>Results</h4>
			        <p>76% of respondents have used the Intranet, 87% have used Oaklandnet.com in the course of their job, and 34% publish information on Oaklandnet.com. Those who publish on Oaklandnet.com gave the Oracle site studio system an average grade of C. This corroborates what we heard in the in-person interviews. Generally speaking, staff can accomplish their publishing tasks, but most encounter obstacles, reach out frequently for help, and feel that the process is constrained and time-consuming. </p>
			        <blockquote>
			        	<p>“The whole process is not very intuitive and restrictive with the sandboxes. I avoid making changes to the website unless I have to.”</p>
			        	<p>“As only one small part of my responsibilities, it is highly time consuming to do minimal changes as needed and then wait for approvals. I tend to save up lots of changes to fix at one time. I am also not as versed in adding pics and other items other than text as its not something I have had the time to practice since learning it several years back.”</p>
			        	<p>“I feel like it is a significant obstacle to regular updates of the website. Staff members who want to use the website are gated from doing so by the training and chain of approvals necessary to make the best use of the CMS.”</p>
			        </blockquote>
			        <p>The concerns with the CMS do not appear to result from training issues. The city has invested a large amount of time and energy in training (minimum of 3 ½ hours for each employee new to the system); however, even employees with several years’ experience working with it are in frequent contact with Mai-Ling, Harry, or Titus for help. Nor is it a problem of overall technical skill level. The employees we were able to speak with in person were all conversant in using tools like word processors and spreadsheets; those who responded to the survey nearly all report using the Internet at home on a regular basis. A well-designed CMS is no more complex than these programs.</p>
			        <p>One interesting finding from the staff survey was how frequently city employees rely on the website for work. The tasks for which they use it vary widely, but many find it their best source of information about the activities of other departments and agencies. At the same time, city employees are the direct backup when members of the public can’t find something on the website. They field calls and counter visits from frustrated people who would rather have done business online. Given this, it’s very likely that a better website will have significant benefits internally as well as for the public.</p>
			        <blockquote>
			        	<p>“info on the website should be located based on NO knowledge of how the city functions. it is currently arranged based on depts, etc.. and the public doesn't understand this so they call random numbers trying to figure out where to go to get the help/info that they need”</p>
			        </blockquote>
			        <h4>Recommendations from Research:</h4>
			        <p>Many of the problems and concerns that we have uncovered are a result of outmoded methods of communications and broadcast have yet to have been updated with the advent of the digital world. The outcomes of antiquated communications have resulted in an unevenly distributed application of online services and a difficulty in reaching those community members that need services the most. </p>
			        <p>Overall, our recommendations focus on bringing Oakland into the 21st century, creating a digitally focused government.  As more and more constituents look to the digital realm to conduct their business, it’s important that governments are able to make government more accessible online. A truly digital government is one that understands the needs of its users, is adept at meeting them where they are and is able to use and treat their digital services as wholly part of their job and responsibilities as they do their brick-and-mortar services.</p>
			        <ol>
			        	<li>Information architecture and clear design will be critical to the success of the new site. More than any other factor, these influence people’s experience throughout the time they spend on the website. This is not work that can be easily outsourced; it will require substantial involvement from the people who know the city and its functions best, i.e. the public servants who work in the government every day.</li>
			        	<li>In order to enable city staff to effectively serve and communicate with their constituents in the digital realm, Oakland needs to provide them with tools that are easy to use and require minimal training. We talked with several public servants who estimated their web-related tasks to take about 3-4 times as long as necessary, with the current CMS as it is now configured. Cutting down the time spent wrestling with technology would allow them to focus on improving the actual content. 
			        	In making decisions about a technical platform for publishing on the web, we strongly recommend that the city prioritize how well it supports users as a top requirement.</li>
			        	<li>To streamline the process of providing robust, useful, digital services, Oakland should look to adopt a “digital first policy”.  This policy would define the requirement that Oakland City Hall should produce all of their information and official documentation in a widely-readable, machine- and human-consumable, format first and foremost, with additional outputs being secondary (pdfs, paper records etc.). Oakland would be leading the country on this initiative, and establishing the appropriate tools to make this as frictionless as possible is paramount. Oakland should aim to have publishing tools that are so much easier to use than the existing methods that city staff prefer to produce information digitally first.</li>
			        	<li>In developing the next version of the Oakland website, the city should begin with experiments and work in an iterative and user-centered way. The research gathered here supports several ideas: 
			        		<ul>
			        			<li>careful attention to organization and information architecture will benefit both residents and public servants.</li>
			        			<li>writing for the web (and not forgetting the mobile web on smaller devices) will result in a site that is easier for everyone to understand.</li>
			        			<li>non-English-speaking residents are also underserved by web content and this is something the website can help if it is designed to do so.</li>
			        			<li>prioritizing the needs of the people who build the website daily will result in greater efficiency and more capacity to tackle real challenges on behalf of residents.</li>
			        		</ul>
			        		In order to do this, the city needs to establish practices of regular user research with both citizens and city staff, and of setting design intentions for web content, collecting metrics, and continuously improving. 
			        		The Alpha website built as part of Phase 1 of this project is designed to gather feedback on exactly the above questions and then be thrown away. The knowledge gained during this next experimental stage will generate a much clearer set of needs and requirements for a more robust and more comprehensive Beta version.

			        <h3>Alpha Website</h3>
			        <p>As a test of the strategy we developed from research, the team built a small proof of concept for a new website, featuring a small subset of the information currently available on the City of Oakland’s website (Public Safety, Jobs and Parking). </p>
			        <p>The main purpose of the Alpha website is to demonstrate some key factors in the way that modern websites are built to better serve the needs of the customer or user, rather than an informational brochure about the company (or, in this case, City Hall).  </p>
			        <p>Example features include:</p>
			        <ul>
			        	<li>An improved information architecture and simplified navigation, presenting a model that revolves around the key city service areas, rather than that of the internal department structure</li>
			        	<li>Plain-language that is easier for users to read and comprehend</li>
			        	<li>The ability to get information in Spanish or Chinese</li>
			        	<li>Calls to action are moved towards the top of pages, so users can find the actionable next-step they are looking for</li>
			        	<li>Canonical URLs for specific pieces of information</li>
			        	<li>A simpler visual design language, emphasising the text content and navigation, whilst also making the site more performant with viewer assets required</li>
			        	<li>Responsive and accessible by default, by using modern HTML and CSS production methods</li>
			        </ul>
			        <p>The Alpha will be live on the Internet at the beginning of November for approximately 3 months at <a href="http://alpha.oakland.codeforamerica.org/">alpha.oakland.codeforamerica.org</a>, and will be subjected to user testing, surveys, data collection and feedback from users both inside and outside of City Hall and will serve as a basis on which a Beta website, and eventually a fully operational complete city website, will be made, iterated on, operated and tested.</p>
			        <p>The public repository for the Alpha codebase can be found on <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/alpha-oakland">github</a>.</p>
