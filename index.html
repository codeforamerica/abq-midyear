    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    
    <p>Code for America is a San Francisco based non-profit that believes government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century. Code for America works with cities to build open source technology and organize a network of people dedicated to making government services simple, effective, and easy to use.</p>

	<p>The Fellowship program sends teams of experienced technologists into local governments across the country to work full-time for a year in partnership with government officials. The fellows apply 21st Century Government Principles to important problems.</p>

	<p>In conjunction, the team is excited to work with leaders in city hall and the community to find new solutions to old problems. We are passionate about doing, not just thinking and will work to always keep our work open and transparent through regularly publishing our work and findings online, holding discussions and co-design session with both community and city partners, and aligning our principles and themes with clear input and validation from experts not only in subject matter but proximity.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    
    <h3>What is the objective?</h3>
    
    <p>As New Mexico’s largest city, the City of Albuquerque is working to increase opportunities for economic development and social mobility for all residents. The CfA has partnered with the Albuquerque Mayor’s Office to research and build interventions to the barriers that residents face in accessing critical information, services, and employment opportunities. Code for America fellows will test and develop a technology solution that facilitates upward mobility for Albuquerque residents. The overall goal — as outlined by the city — is to “enhance the upward mobility of residents by focusing on economic development initiatives.”</p>
    
    <p>To help us understand what that means in digestible terms — here are some points from our initial brief:</p>
    
	<ul>
		<li>Make more people "employable"</li>
		<li>Remove barriers to information about jobs, job opportunities, employer incentives</li>
		<li>Create pathways from family services to skills for employment to access to jobs</li>
		<li>Surface and identify 'soft skills and services' to enable people to look for work (daycare, nice clothes, etc).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>How will this affect the City of Albuquerque?</h3>
	
	<p>There are two types of defined outcomes, <strong>Primary</strong> and <strong>Organizational</strong>.</p>
	
	<h4>Primary Outcomes</h4>
	
	<p>The largest is to connect the dots and standardize some of the communications and data being shared between the city and it’s residents around economic development departments, initiatives, and community partners. The city would also like to see us ‘refresh’ some of the technology now used for skills based hiring. Including hiring within city hall. Another stinging objective is to improve access to talent for small businesses moving to or operating out of the metro area.</p>
	
	<h4>Organization Outcomes</h4>
	
	<p>The first thing we heard from our city partner when we stepped foot in City Hall is to be ‘catalyst for change!’ No kidding, by the brief it states: “make stakeholders see that change is possible and inexpensive.” Another outcome, that’s less ominous is to grow the civic tech community and improve sustainability for new services. Lastly, to scale up data opportunities and allow the city to become “information rich, instead of simply data rich.”</p>
	
	<p>As a team we look to achieve a bold solution to a bold problem — by setting our aims high we can fail gracefully — in a way that builds trust towards the boom and bust tendencies of the work in technological fields. In hopes that our actions will inspire others to think differently about how to operate local governments in the 21st century.</p>

<section id="research">
	<h2>Research</h2>
	
	<blockquote>
		<p>The factor that holds residents back ... <strong>alone</strong> in the process.</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>We have been working diligently to define boundaries in which to construct the problem space and create interventions within. As you may have discerned from the objectives above, the scope is fairly large. Therefore, as designers and technologists we believe in working iteratively which requires a good basis of principles and themes as a grounding force in what can otherwise be whimsical, and eventually futile, work without guard rails.</p>
	
	<h3>Design Principles</h3>
	
	<p>There are two principles that we will align with at every turn of the design process.</p>
	
	<h4>A Positive Narrative</h4>
	
	<p>Despite having a history of negative representation in the media, residents see an opportunity to positively enhance Albuquerque’s narrative. As one resident put it, “we are not good at telling our own story.” Through conversations with the community it became clear that negative opinions about Albuquerque have found their way into the minds of many residents. Both from large, external sources like The New Yorker and Rolling Stone (who both profiled the city’s police departments in the last year) to small local news sources focusing their attention on anything with dram, drugs or violence.</p>
	
	<p>There is an opportunity to help grow residents’ confidence in themselves and in Albuquerque as a unique place to live. Our goal is to draw out and amplify the already existing positive narrative.</p>
	
	<p>We will deploy a positive narrative in our work. Meaning that all the elements of our work — from color to fonts, to graphic design and all the way to story, framing, and thesis — will be chosen deliberately with a positive underlying tone. Through doing this we hope our work will support the initiatives that are already successfully operating in this space.</p>
	
	<p>We’ve failed if our work is not aligned with the positive messages that the city is trying to embrace. We’ll work with residents constantly to keep our narratives grounded by the community’s voice.</p>
	
	<h4>Recognizing Multiculturalism</h4>
	
	<p>The City of Albuquerque is home not only to a vast and colorful landscape but also to a unique and richly textured community that continues to capture imaginations. Multiculturalism requires that we be conscious of the cultural diversity within the city as we create products and services. It is important that we understand and leverage the diverse cultural perspectives and local capacity already existing within the community. As University of New Mexico professor laureate and director of the film and digital media program Miguel Gandert told us, “multiculturalism means that various cultures in a society merit equal respect.” Gandert’s words inspire us to use the most inclusive language in our work and align with the already existing community building progress. Most importantly, it will help us frame our concepts and solution in relation to the work already being done within the community.</p>
	
	<p>We believe that being culturally grounded and inclusive will help us identify a diversity of champions with whom we can partner in specific focus areas. In the long term, this can help the city engage with local leaders that might not come through the traditional routes of higher education or politics to get into city hall. In larger part, aligning with the organizational outcome of “skill based hiring in city hall.”</p>
	
	<p>We’ve failed if our work doesn’t take Albuquerque’s cultural particularities into consideration at every step and we haven’t identified leaders and champions from outside the ranks of the traditional echelons of power. We will also have failed if we fail to identify a cultural taboo and trip up on it without learning from our mistake. This will happen — as none of us are from New Mexico — and part of this principle is to have a contingent response for when it does.</p>

	<h3>Design Themes (Lenses)</h3>
	
	<p>There are four themes that we will use as containers in which to decode the issues:
		<ul>
			<li>Workforce Development</li>
			<li>Education</li>
			<li>Poverty</li>
			<li>Inclusion</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<article id="workforce">
		<h4>Workforce: Skills to Independence</h4>
		
		<p>Workforce is a broad area of economic development that has many players, ideas, and a legacy of solution focused interventions such as TABE testing and GED preparation. Albuquerque is no exception. There are many organizations doing profound work in this area across the spectrum, from displaced high school students to the underemployed and unemployed, all the way across to micro-businesses and entrepreneurs. </p>
		
		<p>On the end of the spectrum where hardships like displacement and poverty are daily stressors, residents said that the most challenging issue is the lack of awareness of city services and opportunities. As one resident said when we talked to her at the New Mexico Workforce Connection Center, “I pulled over over 500 jobs here in Albuquerque alone for nursing. Carpenters, plumbers you name it, it’s right there… you just need to go. I think a lot of people don’t know that’s where they need to go.” </p>
		
		<p>Other challenges for residents include forming external networks, developing career navigation skills, and having a clear roadmap to jobs with growth potential. While they are ‘soft skills,’ they are tremendously valuable. External networks are those that have multiple points of contact — it has as much to do with access as it does with reputation. It’s an area that most in hardship don’t see as a huge possibility but could be the difference between getting an interview or not. A career roadmap was another need. This would help residents know where they might stand on the path to a certain career.</p>
		
		<p>We see an opportunity to more effectively empower low-income and poor residents  with respect to applying for jobs, posturing themselves as outstanding candidates, creating external networks, and developing an actionable roadmap that provides a clear path to  high-growth industries.</p>
		
		<p>For immigrant business owners,  some of the biggest needs include fostering a direct relationship with the city to know about infrastructure development in their areas, hands-on entrepreneurship training, understanding the steps to scale their enterprise, and mentorship.  Other needs included access to alternative sources of capital, needing assistance with in-house tasks such as branding,  and understanding accounting and tasks. Immigrant business owners share a lot of needs with the hardship spectrum of workforce development but through a very different lens. Whereas the residents in hardship are looking for access and support, the immigrant community is looking for deeper access to information and support through consistent communication.</p>
		
		<p>We see the City’s current efforts to create an innovative and technology focused downtown as a resource for those who are looking to grow their skills and advance to the next stage in their career. As the nation’s workforce becomes more independent either by choice or force, it is crucial that all residents are equipped with the skills to navigate their careers. We’ve taken a particular interest in the independent workforce population as it spans the entire spectrum from contingency workers like those in domestic or seasonal agricultural occupations to boutique workers like yoga instructors and Uber drivers.</p>
		
		<p>As we continue to explore this area, we will focus on what a workforce consists of, how workforces change over time, and how to support residents as it changes. This theme is the heart of economic mobility for any city and we are excited to take a long hard look through our continuation of research and prototypes.</p>

	<article id="education">
		<h4>Education: Mobility and Advancement</h4>
		
		<p>The City of Albuquerque is constantly working to grow the number of educated and literate residents. According to a recent report written by the New Mexico Voices for Children, New Mexico ranks 46th in the nation in the percentage of community college students who go on to obtain certificate or degrees in a 3-year period or transfer to a 4-year college. Furthermore, only 30% of all participants who start adult education programs complete them and only 8% transition into college or occupational after exiting their program.</p>
		
		<p>Youth Development Incorporated (YDI) has been working for over a decade with students who did not finish high school and youth whose misfortune lead them to juvenile incarceration. YDI helps students complete their GED or post-secondary education, and move into meaningful careers.</p>
		
		<p>Workshops and hands-on instruction are another crucial component of  economic opportunity and development. One example, quietly occupying its new space downtown is the Coding Bootcamp at the CNM STEMulus Center. Starting only in the last few years — John Mierzwa saw an opportunity to train and place coders into newer businesses that were desperately searching for talent. Although they started small, they’ve shown significant success and many of the graduates are involved and committed. The opportunity Mierzwa saw is not hard to justify; throughout the United States coding bootcamps have a 63% placement rate for full-time employment averaging a starting salary of $80,000. Wow! Right!? We think this a fabulous example of just how integral education is in professional development.</p>
		
		<p>We see an opportunity to help residents find well-defined pathways leading to post-secondary and industry recognized credentials in growing industry sectors. We hope to accomplish this by drawing from,  helping advance, and connecting the already strong work of organizations such as Youth Development Inc and the CNM STEMulus Center.</p>

	<article id="inclusion">
		<h4>Inclusion: Innovation and Discovery</h4>
		
		<p>The City of Albuquerque is spearheading an initiative to grow a long-lasting technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship community downtown that “connects the dots” between communities and the city. A central concern among residents is connecting the new innovation initiative to the broader Albuquerque community that exists outside of the conventional technology and entrepreneurship world. As one resident put it “I hope that we don’t leave out already marginalized communities as we innovate.”</p>
		
		<p>Much of the problem lies in the fact that different communities are not communicating and thereby lack awareness of one another’s activities. There is a suspicion from the past that things are not being done for the right reasons. Surprisingly, we have found the opposite — everyone we met showed us things that suggested their door was open for conversations and feedback. As we expressed in our principles, we want to engage and generate as much of those conversations as possible.</p>
	
		<p>We hope to engage all types of entrepreneurs working in every corner of the City. Take for example, Kei Tsuzuki and Molly Luethi, two female entrepreneurs who run Kei & Molly Textiles LLC, a South East Heights based printing studio dedicated to creating artisan-quality, hand-printed fabric goods. Kei and Molly are committed to holding community based workshops and hiring refugee woman and equipping them with the important job skills to flourish in the community. They believe that they can help revitalize Albuquerque’s International District while sharing their skills. </p>
		
		<p>Another population we hope to engage are the millennials, the newest generation that is more connected than ever and has more self-sufficiency than any before it. It’s predicted that 16% of millennials are not even looking for work or having given up their search. We’d be willing to predict that a lot of these new workers will probably find ways to work independently. One example is Roxanne Blair who does excellent work in Albuquerque by way of her venture, Creative Start-ups. She works with local residents to help incubate creative businesses and projects. She has worked with a diversity of entrepreneurs, ranging from a young woman who works with Navajo tribes to make jewelry to a physical trainer who designs products to help people with long term fascia pain.</p>
		
		<p>As the City continues to define the downtown innovation district, we see an opportunity to more effectively connect local communities and residents, be they entrepreneurs like Molly and Kei, millennials like Roxanne, immigrants, independent works,  senior citizens, low-income, or involuntarily part-time workers. Our work will look to help create more connecting points and opportunities for all residents.</p>

	<article id="hardship">
		<h4>Hardship: Underserved and Underutilized</h4>
		
		<p>It is often difficult to define economic hardship. A well versed lab technician could lose his job and find himself in hardship. Or a senior in college could have a car accident and drop out. This is actually a problem that Robin Brulé and Shana Runck are working to solve with the Stay @ UNM project. Through a local credit union they’ve set up a service that gives students no-interest loans to finish school. The only thing they have to agree to is a series of financial management workshops and a couple of one-on-one financial counseling sessions. It’s a win for the institution and the student, and as a bonus any delinquency on these loans will never be reported as bad credit.</p>
		
		<p>On the other side of the spectrum of hardship we see a pill that is hard to swallow. 70% of New Mexico is working poor. You’re working poor if you receive at least one social service. The poverty rate in Albuquerque has steadily increased over the past 7 years, affecting youth 18-24 years old and children under 5 years old the most. It’s predicted that almost 1/5th of the residents are living below the poverty line. For children it’s even worse at 29% believed to be living in poverty.</p>
		
		<p>While in Albuquerque we spent a couple of mornings volunteering at The Storehouse. This foodbank has been operating for more than 47 years feeding the working poor and homeless. It’s been around so long it’s created a network of churches who hold specific types of food drives to fulfill its needs. The Storehouse created partnerships with local grocery stores and employs many residents volunteering and working under disability. The Storehouse has served around 50,000 local families with food and clothing.</p>
		
		<p>Throughout our conversations with civic servants and community service providers, the most common ask from the city was increased access to and awareness of social services for low-income resident in Albuquerque. There is a significant need for a centralized and easily updatable repository of these services. The residents also want more access as well as more awareness for what is already happening. We’ll seek to make our project represent the needs of those that need the most in hopes of uplifting their quality of life through providing more opportunity.</p>

<section id="challenges">
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	
	<p>The largest challenge in doing any type of fellowship work is not competing and aligning with existing efforts. This has a lot to do with our goal of wanting our project to continue to be used and maintained after we leave. The founder of the CfA Jen Pahlka has recently been preaching “Opps not Apps” which to us means we need to be careful that we are not building stuff without awareness. This specifically relates back to our design principles. Lastly, we want to actually help those who need help the most. This is a big statement, we know, but we’ve made a commitment to our team this year that we want to do something that is bold and replicable, something that will affect many residents in Albuquerque now and in the future.</p>

	<h2>Thank You</h2>
	
	<p>While in Albuquerque we found an incredible amount of hospitality from the residents. We were never questioned in our intentions and were always welcomed into many businesses and homes alike. We are immensely grateful to the individuals who helped us gather these initial findings and will continue to offer our support through teaching, hosting, or facilitating the technologies which we are experts in. The team would simply like to say thank you for the openness and willingness to talk with us and participate in this process over the year of 2015.</p>
